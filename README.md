* Where: Verlindo Comunicação, Brasília, Brazil.
* What: [Roman Numerals](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataRomanNumerals)
  and [Roman Calculator](http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataRomanCalculator) from Coding Dojo.
* How: Rust, with the goal with getting ourselves familiarized with the language.


Attendance
==========

* Felipe Lessa (@meteficha, sensei)
* Daniel Saad (@danielsaad)
* Halian Vilela (@halian-vilela)
* Ruben Cruz (@rubencruz)
* Edward Ribeiro (@eribeiro)
* Bruno Berto


Final thoughts
==============

* Halian: lifetime's asshole is cock.
* Saad: memory safety is very nice. 
* Everyone liked the fact that Rust has builtin support for unit testing. 
* Ruben: didn't like the fact that it wasn't straightforward to use strings.
* Edward: liked the strong static type system.
* Trying to use a language no one knows is though.
* Felipe: the final code has some nice symmetries that noone was able to see
  until a lot of code was already written.


Next dojo
=========

Nobody else wanted to be the next sensei, so the next one will be myself again
using Rust :).
